We've settled on the dates for NodePDX 2012. Mark your calendars off for Feb. 11/12, 2012. 

This will be a *free* conference for attendees. If you're a business that wants to sponsor us and offset some of our costs, please contact Troy or Adron to discuss.

For everyone else: We're accepting proposals for talks and working out event space details now. More to come!
